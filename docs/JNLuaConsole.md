JNLua includes a simple Lua console for experimenting with JNLua. The console is provided by the class `LuaConsole`.

The console collects input until a line with the sole content of the word **go** is encountered. At that point, the collected input is run as a Lua chunk. If the Lua chunk loads and runs successfully, the console displays the returned values of the chunk as well as the execution time based on a `System.nanoTime()` measurement. Otherwise, the console shows the error that has occurred.

Expressions can be printed by prepending **=** to the expression at the beginning of a chunk. The console translates **=** into **return** followed by a space and executes the chunk immediately. No separate **go** is required. Therefore, expressions printed this way must be entered on a single line.
